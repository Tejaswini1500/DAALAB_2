    /* C Program to sort an array in ascending order using Insertion Sort */

     

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)

    {

        int n, i, j, temp;

        int arr[64];

        printf("Enter number of elements\n");

        scanf("%d", &n);

        printf("Enter %d integers\n", n);

        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) 

        {

            scanf("%d", &arr[i]);

        }

        for (i = 1; i < n; i++) 

        {

            j = i;

            while (j > 0 && arr[j - 1] > arr[j]) 

            {

                temp = arr[j];

                arr[j] = arr[j - 1];

                arr[j - 1] = temp;

                j--;

            }

        }

        printf("Sorted list in ascending order:\n");

        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) 

        {

            printf("%d\n", arr[i]);

        return 0;

1. Average case (Unsorted array): When the input array has random distribution of numbers.

For example:

If the input array is {3, 7, 2, 9, 5}
the expected output array will have data as {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}

2. Best case (Sorted Array): When the input array is already sorted, in that case we have to make minimum number of swaps.
For example:

If the input array has data as {-3, 31, 66}        
then the expected output array will have data as {-3, 31, 66}

3. Worst Case (Reverse sorted array): When the array is sorted in a reverse manner, in that case we have to make maximum number of swaps.

For example:

If the input array has elements as {9, 8, 6, 3, 1}
then the output array will have data as {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}

Insertion Sort Algorithm:

1. We will store the random set of numbers in an array.
2. We will traverse this array and insert each element of this array, to its correct position where it should actually be, by shifting the other elements on the left if required.
3. The first element in the array is considered as sorted, even if it is an unsorted array. The array is sub-divided into two parts, the first part holds the first element of the array which is considered to be sorted and second part contains all the remaining elements of array.
4. With each iteration one element from the second part is picked and inserted into the first part of array at its correct position by shifting the existing elements if required.
5. This goes until the last element in second part of array is placed in correct position in the output array.
6. Now, we have the array in sorted order.

Insertion Sort Example:

If we have the array as {40,10,50,70,30}
and we apply insertion sort to sort the array,
then the resultant array after each iteration will be as follows:

               Original array: {40, 10, 50, 70, 30}

Array after first iteration is     10 ->  40    ->  50   ->   70   ->   30
Array after second iteration is    10 ->  40    ->  50   ->   70   ->   30
Array after third iteration is     10 ->  40    ->  50   ->   70   ->   30
Array after fourth iteration is    10 ->  30    ->  40   ->   50   ->   70
            
               Sorted array is  10  30  40  50  70

Program Explanation

1. Using a for loop, we are reading n elements from standard input into an array named arr.
2. Next, we are comparing elements of the array so that we can insert them in the proper position using the insertion sort method.
3. At the end, we are printing/displaying the sorted array.

Time Complexity:
The worst and average case time complexity of insertion sort algorithm is O(N2) while the best case time complexity of insertion sort is O(N).

Space Complexity: O(1)
The space complexity for insertion sort is O(1) if we only consider the order of space used excluding the array.
Runtime Test Cases

Here’s the run time test cases for Insertion sort algorithm for 3 different input cases.

Test Case 1 – Average Case: Here, the elements are entered in random order.

/* Average case */
 
Enter number of elements
5
Enter 5 integers
3 7 2 9 5
Sorted list in ascending order:
2
3
5
7
9

Test Case 2 – Best Case: Here, the elements are already sorted.

/* Best case */
 
Enter number of elements
3
Enter 3 integers
-3 31 66
Sorted list in ascending order:
-3
31
66

Test Case 3 – Worst Case: Here, the elements are reverse sorted.

/* Worst case */
 
Enter number of elements
5
Enter 5 integers
9 8 6 3 1
Sorted list in ascending order:
1
3
6
8
9
